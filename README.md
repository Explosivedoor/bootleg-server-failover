# Bootleg Server Failover
A guide for a bootleg server failover for those of us too cheap to pay like, $5 a month.
My use case for this is because I too don't want to pay $5 a month, and to have a server closer to those who access it. My main server is in Japan, my backup in the US. 

Let's start with the things you will need for this: 
1. Your (home) sever. Could be an old laptop or a 4u you bought because you thought that was a good idea to have in a 1 bedroom apartment. Mine is running Ubuntu. 
2. A second server that is offsite (ie. not in your 1 bedroom apartment) usually one with good uptime and terminal access. I use namecheap.com shared hosting for this. 
3. Cloudflare account
4. (optional) Telegram to get notification when your server goes down.
5. (optional) Rasberry Pi/Le Potato/Orange Pi/whatever
